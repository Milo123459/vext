# vext
ðŸ¤™ Vext is a code editor that lives in the Terminal.

Vext is written in pure [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) and is ridiculously memory & CPU efficient. Vext exposes rich APIs for writing plugins, and plugins can be written in V.

This project was used to learn V, because I'm a strong Rustacean, this was a bit of a challenge!

Anyway, this code editor comes with rich features (well, planned, since you know.. it's quite a challenge!) including:

- Status bar
- Extension API
- Themeing
- Run VSCode extensions via open-vsx (ðŸŽ‰)
- Split windows
- Tabs
- ...other stuff you can suggest in issues

## Planned usage

`vext ./file`

`vext ./folder`
