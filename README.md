# vext
🤙 Vext is a code editor that lives in the Terminal.

Vext is written in pure Rust and is ridiculously memory & CPU efficient. Vext exposes rich APIs for writing plugins, and plugins can be written in Rust.

Anyway, this code editor comes with rich features (well, planned, since you know.. it's quite a challenge!) including:

- Status bar
- Extension API
- Themeing
- Split windows
- Tabs
- ...other stuff you can suggest in issues

## Planned usage

`vext ./file`

`vext ./folder`
